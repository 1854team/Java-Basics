# Java-Basics
Basic Java snippets &amp; small programs as a reference for bigger projects.

These are various basic snippets found over the internet.  I retype & study the snippets to use as forms for other projects.  

I normally save these snippets in a private document format, but Java ends up being so big it made sense to use Git to store the snippets.
